# Welcome to Binary Playground! 👋

A digital sandbox 🏖️ where code gets to climb, swing, and sometimes fall (fail, safely of course).

## 👾 What Happens Here?

Think of this as a mix between a lab and a jungle gym: 
- 🎨 Themes and plugins that run my sites
- 🔧 Experimental apps, tools & utilities  
- 📐 3D Models and Acrylic designs

Mostly weird. Sometimes useful. Always fun.

## 🛠 Playground Gear

Right now I'm mostly messing with:
- 🌐 PHP, Javascript, WordPress, Laravel & web things
- 🤖 AI - Claude, OpenAI
- 🧱 3D Modelling - Bambu Lab A1, XTool P2S

## 🚧 Under Construction

Projects pop up here when curiosity strikes. For now here are some placeholders...

- 🧪 `weird-little-tool` — makes something slightly easier
- 🎨 `visual-code-thingy` — because I wanted to see if I could
- 🕹️ `tiny-game-or-sim` — press buttons, get dopamine

## 💭 Motto

> “Build things. Break stuff. Learn loudly.”

🛝 Come play in the code — just don't run with scissors ✂️
